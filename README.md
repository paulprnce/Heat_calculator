🔥 Heat Exchanger Calculator (Web Application)

This project is a Heat Exchanger Calculator developed using Python and Streamlit to help users quickly estimate heat transfer performance in common heat exchanger systems. The application allows users to input operating parameters and instantly compute key thermal metrics using standard heat transfer equations.

The tool supports fundamental calculations such as heat transfer rate (Q), log mean temperature difference (LMTD), and overall heat transfer analysis, making it useful for chemical, mechanical, and process engineering applications. It is designed with a simple, interactive web interface for ease of use and learning.
